To correct this issue, make sure to always include spaces around the +,-,*,/ operators inside the `calc()` function.  The correct syntax is demonstrated below:

```css
width:calc(100% - 10px);
height:calc(50% + 20px);
margin:calc(100px / 2);
```
By adding spaces, the CSS parser will correctly interpret the expression and perform the calculation.
